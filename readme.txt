Avocados can not be downloaded : "Tainted canvases may not be exported."
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20424279/canvas-todataurl-securityerror

"Although you can use images without CORS approval in your canvas, doing so taints the canvas. Once a canvas has been tainted, you can no longer pull data back out of the canvas. For example, you can no longer use the canvas toBlob(), toDataURL(), or getImageData() methods; doing so will throw a security error.
This protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote web sites without permission.
